# Datacat 
Datacat is a decentralised data annotation platform which provides bias free annotation capabilities by decentralizing the task of data annotation.
We achieve this by spinning up different subnets using **IPC** that are geographically locked

## Circle :-  
We are using Circle in our project for its smart contract platform and developer wallets capability. 
We are using the developer wallets to distribute the funds to our hardworking annotators. 
The smart contract platform is used to abstract away the technical aspects of signing transactions so that technically challenged people do not feel left out.  

## Dynamic :-
We are using dynamic for its capability of abstracting the web3 user onboarding process.
We have used the dynamicSDK to onboard users.

## WorldCoin :-
We are using the sybil resistance properties of world coin to ensure that the annotators on our platform are all human and no bots.
We are using the world coin SDK (ID kit) to achieve this.

## Filecoin (IPC) :-

## HyperScale :-
